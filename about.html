  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Where Information Was Sourced</h2>
    <p>All candidate information and statement are taken directly from candidates’ official websites. A Candidate’s official website is the sole source we use. If a candidate doesn’t have a statement for a certain issue, we show it as “Not Answered.”</p>

    <h2>How The Questions Were Designed</h2>
    <p>Questions were defined by reviewing all candidates’ statements, and the most frequently mentioned topics were chosen.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>How The Results Are Calculated</h2>
    <p>For each question, users can vote for one candidate, and that candidate receives one point. If users choose to skip a question, that question won’t count toward the final score.</p>

  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>What Tools Were Used</h2>
    <p>This website was designed using Figma and developed with HTML, CSS, and React. It is an open-source project hosted on GitHub. ChatGPT-4.0 and DeepSeek were used to enhance the neutrality and clarity of the writing.S</p>
